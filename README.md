This is a simple calculator project done on my own time to practice and touch up my basic coding skills. I implemented a switch function with a condition for each of the four fundamental arithmetic operators (+, -, /, and *).
Based on the user's input, this code will output the results in the local terminal. 
The calculator will also ask the user at the end of the calculation if they wish to continue making calculations, and if not, the program ends.
